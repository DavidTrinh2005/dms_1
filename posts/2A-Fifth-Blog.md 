Today we utilised microphones to capture audio for our icons. We utilised the Zoom H2N model and went around campus to capture different natural audio. 

After this, I spent time at home trying to record some appropriate noises that would best suit the vibe and style choice of my icons. jkblblbkllblblllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
