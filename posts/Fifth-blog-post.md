The key moment or otherwise the moment of turn around is once I grab hold of a dated diary and rip off the note dated "March 1", which is the day of my grandmothers tragic passing but also the exact moment when I began reflecting upon how fragile life is and that was the moment of realisation that prompted this more virtuous and hopeful depiction of me. To capture this in my shortfilm, I will have two different tracks playing to represent the two distinctive identites and lives I had lived. The first piece titled "REBOOT.EXE" has a really slow paced build up which is ideal for the concept of building up to my character development, this piece also possesses a dreary feel which paird with the environmental ambience of certain scenes will help elevate the cinematic experience. And the second track titled "I Just Felt" is also an emotionally empowering composition that drives home that end of the journey feel and evokes this sense of ease and comfort towards the the second segment of my shortfilm. The association between the title tracks and also the visuals is also a subtle double entendre of how I particularly felt at those two differing periods of time. 

I wish to incorporate synchresis between my visuals and audio/sound effects. Having subtle sound effects (e.g.: car driving by) laid over the background audio will provide a depth in the context of its environment. I will also occasionally promote real time audio sound captured in parts of the original footage to ellicit the rawness and autenticity of the environements and the actions and objects associated with them to provide the diegesis.
