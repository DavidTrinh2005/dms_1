The key moment or otherwise the moment of turn around is once I grab hold of a dated diary and rip off the note dated "March 1", which is the day of my grandmothers tragic passing but also the exact moment when I began reflecting upon how fragile life is and that was the moment of realisation that prompted this more virtuous and hopeful depiction of me. To capture this in my shortfilm, I will have two different tracks playing to represent the two distinctive lifestyles. The first piece titled "REBOOT.EXE" has a really slow paced build up which is ideal for the concept of building up to my character development. And the second track titled "I Just Felt" is also an emotionally empowering composition that drives home that end of the journey feel and evokes this sense of ease and comfort towards the the second segment of my shortfilm. The association between the title tracks and also the visuals is also a subtle double entendre of how I particularly felt or experience the world.
