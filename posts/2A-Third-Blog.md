This week we explored the complexities of colour and colour theory, drawing in pre-existing ideas and concepts of shape, composition, line, and etc...

For a segment in our lession, we explored colour association and the discussion of geo-locations were brought up. The link below demonstrates how differing colours representing a feeling or emotion best captures the different countries.

Here, I have also began designing my icons in accordance to the pre-existing design ideas that I have established. I experimented around with various tools to optimise my effeciency going into the few final designs.

^ I jumped straight into a more abstract design colour choice, I included palettes such as the complementary and triadic colours systems in hopes of exhibiting more of a metaphyscial and conceptual aesthetic, something unlike your everyday sporty icon designs. I do prefer this direction as it'll give my designs more of a pop and invites the audience of all skill levels to tag along in this fitness journey.
