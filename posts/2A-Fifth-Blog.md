In this session we began experimenting with audio recordings for our icons. In class, we borrowed a microphone and tested them out around the campus. I collected these sounds and soon transferred them into the computers. These sounds were soon captured in our displayed icons to provide an audiovisual feedback. We utilised Adobe Audition to crop, layover, fade audio clips to ensure that any excess audio feedback was present. Overall, the use of the program was crop and ensure that the starting and ending layouts of audio timeline were appropriately cut out.

As a last ditch effort, I wasn't successful in finding a couple sounds that I was happy with so I reference a few sounds directly sourced from YouTube Library as well as a few from FreeSound in order to retrieve sounds that were otherwise unachieveable from my end.
