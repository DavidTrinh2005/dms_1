The draft I have is currently under progress, it requires proper visual and audio transitions. A few more clips are yet to be added to complete the whole timeline of footage. Over the past few weeks I have been reshooting scenes as weather conditions, natural lighthing, and differing angles required improvement. This draft still requires a decent amount of post production editing as it still under production.
