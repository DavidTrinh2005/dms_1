The draft I have is currently under progress, it requires proper visual and audio transitions. A few more clips are yet to be added to complete the whole timeline of footage. Over the past few weeks I have been reshooting scenes as weather conditions, natural lighthing, and differing angles required improvement. This draft still requires a decent amount of post production editing as it still under production.

We also captured videos given an array of prompts. The video provided was shot by fellow classmates depicting loneliness. We were allowcated time in class to incorporate music from Youtube Library as well as its sound effects deriving from the soundboard.
