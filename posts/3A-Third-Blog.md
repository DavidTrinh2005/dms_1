## Principles of Navigation 

In this session, Mx Thomas went through the different ways in which we may help navigate and guide our user to the desired or intended space. Concepts such as body and space, entrances, and orientation are factors that we are required to critically consider when implenting them into our project designs. 

On a contrasting note, Mx Thomas also taught us how to implement terrain height and paint under the terrain menu guide. For a short while, we developed a prototype world with more depth through texture, colour, and terrain height. Adding onto this, Mx Thomas also taught us how to implement 3D asset plug ins to give the world more character and further depth. In this case, I added a wild forest creature.

# Homework

For this session, I began implementing asset overlays on my pre-existing primitives. I began with city buildings that I've manipulated to give differing size effects. I toggled around with the scale menu containing the X,Y, and Z catalogue to give off a tall, wide, and long effect to my buildings. I also added a plane and placed a texture mod on it to paint out a road and side walks to provide depth to my city scape.
