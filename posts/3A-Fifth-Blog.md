## Homework

Due to severe illness, I was unable to receive feedback from fellow peers. However, I asked my brother to do a playthrough test run of my world. I recorded this testing session and have uploaded it onto YouTube. The main points of criticism that he noted were the following; 

+ World building is quite expansive
+ More interactions and action commands could be utilised here (I couldn't achieve this as I was in isolation and my device storage is not capable of rendering big projects and scripts)
+ Final destination could have had more sound elemtns and assets incorporated 

His positive comments however, consisted of;

+ Association of emotions to the respected worlds
+ The audio source travelling from the viruses were a good touch
+ The abstract build of the creative space was excellently designed
+ The layout of the city scape and the metaphor of chaos and overwhelming spread of COVID-19 was quite innovative.
