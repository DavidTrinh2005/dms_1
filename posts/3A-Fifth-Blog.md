## Building and Recording

## Homework

Due to severe illness, I was unable to receive feedback from fellow peers. However, I asked my brother to do a playthrough test run of my world. I recorded this testing session and have uploaded it onto YouTube. The main points of criticism that he noted were the following; 

+ World building is quite expansive
+ A tad few more interactions and action commands could be utilised here 
+ Final destination could have had more sound elements and assets incorporated 

His positive comments however, consisted of;

+ Association of emotions to the respected worlds
+ The audio source travelling from the viruses were a good touch
+ The abstract build of the creative space was excellently designed
+ The layout of the city scape and the metaphor of chaos and overwhelming spread of COVID-19 was quite innovative.
+ Space is navigable and coherent

Below is my brothers demo gameplay, I offered him 5-7 minutes to have a crack at the game and he completed in 4 minutes, he didn't have a hard time making his way around the map and made sure that he took in the details of the world. For the most part, he enjoyed it and I look forward to potentially working with unity more in the future.
