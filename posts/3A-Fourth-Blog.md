# Space and Sound

## Sound in Unity

In this session, Mx Thomas went through the slides regarding audio and sound in unity, touching upon concepts such as audio landmarks, sense of place, and progress and evolution. Emphasizing the importance of spatial audio, audio interaction, and how audio influences cognitive functions, perception, emotions and mood. Mx Thomas guided us through implementing audio samples to assets and prefabs, enabling audio proximity - meaning that the closer we interact with the specific asset, the louder the audio amplifies. Mx Thomas also suggested that we configure the audio source menu.

# Homework 

As part of the homework task, I have sampled audio from FreeSound, a designated platform for free to use audio samples and sound effects submitted by users around the world. I purposefully took samples from user EdTK, cydon, and daDDdoiT. I also sampled a track by Viacheslav who goes by the elias "original_soundtrack" on Pixabay. I got my hands onto the Pixabay licensing content and in turn was able to utilise Viacheslavs' track called **"Space Ambient Cinematic Music"**. Viacheslavs'music has a dramatic and desperate feel which excellently encapsulates the feel and tale that I'm looking to showcase. 

With the creative space, I wanted to initially incorporate wood wind instrumentals to illicit a foreign and unfamiliar experience, but instead I took on chimes, I purposefully chose this sound as chimes as they typically displayed in front of homes as welcome token to new guests. I wanted to take that audiovisual cue as a symbolic reference to my transition from being isolated at home and not doing very much to opening up or introducing myself into this creative hobby. On a differing note, I want my final destination **(the home)** to have a very minimalistic, nostalgic and easy sound effect. The subtle volume of the bird chirping should create feelings of ease and comfort, it's representative of my experience of returning back to life and society after suffering a devastating pandemic. My aim is to commemcommemorate the feelings of happiness and hope that I had felt once the world began to get back on its feet once again.
