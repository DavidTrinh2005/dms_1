In preparation for Assignment 2, lecturer Cy Gorman broke down the fundemental principles and elements that we would need consider upon curating our ideas for the icon designs. Such questions as, what is the market audience here? - what is our niche? - how does the idea transition from one state/position to another - what are correlations and indifferences relevant to the idea and how may we apply these to the overarching concept?

Within the second half of our class, we were tasked to complete different designs correlating to a specific thematic prompt. Eight designs were required for all six prompts. Once the designs were completed, we were tasked to select the single best design amongst every prompt. I'm currently in the process of completing this page.
