In the second half of the week we brushed back upon the theory and design element choices that we should consider when interpreting how it such components can and should be incorporated into our icon designs. We were also presented with several websites that contained a database of auto-generated images as a basis for references and insiration. Later in the class, we were tasked to create 20 designs based off of a thematic concept, we were assigned 15 minutes to complete this task.
