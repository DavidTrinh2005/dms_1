In the second half of the week we brushed back upon the theory and design element choices that we should consider when interpreting how it such components can and should be incorporated into our icon designs. We were also presented with several websites that contained a database of auto-generated images as a basis for references and insiration. Later in the class, we were tasked to create 20 designs based off of a thematic concept, we were assigned 15 minutes to complete this task.

We were also tasked to create several graphic designs icons. For every individual con, we were prompted to sketch five sketches per icon (making 45 icons). I went for a more cartoon-y aesthetic/design as I felt that it suits more of the Iphone icon design style. Popular web apps such as Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram take on very minimalistic and geometrical design form which is something that I wish to take on.
