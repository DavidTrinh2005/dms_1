## Spatial Environment Modelling 

In our first official session for assignment 3, we began by examining the brief and breaking down what is required of us to complete within this assignment. The overarching goal is to create a "navigable" or otherwise operable playbox that depicts a space or setting that represents a transformation that we (the students) have undergone at some point during our lives. This transformation may be portrayed through an emotional, intellectual, or geographical change.

## Space Modelling Practice 

In class, we were tasked to replicate the model of a solar system, using SolarSystemScope as the basis for our model. It is within this site, where we sampled the textured elements and materials needed to colourize our geometric shapes. In this demo, Mx. Thomas provided us a runthrough of how to install and operate UnityHub as well to the solar system model to life.

## Solar System Model 

This here was my finished product. The design is rather simple yet intuitive, I will look further into sourcing different assets that appear more natural as I had ran into an issue of having to piece together two assets to form saturn - being the ring and the sphere itself. I looked onto SketchFad for inspiration and discovered alot of fantastic results!

# Homework Task

## Mind Map (Emotional Transformation)

I have created a mindmap with a series of emotions and themes associated to them. I have chosen to make three individual encounters that represent the following emotions; sadness and grief, hopeful and joy, and happy and peaceful. My goal is to form three open worlds that represent different periods of time and the emotions associated with it. I chose this transformation in particular because I felt that the most creative ideas come from the most personal experiences.

 ## Topdown View Plan

Below I have attached an image of my topview plan. The order begins from the right (city scape) and travels towards the left where it meets the **creative space** and then followed by the final destination **home**. The concept of this project is to present my emotional transformation commencing from the COVID-19 pandemic up until the present timeline. I want to capture COVID-19 in an apolcolyptic style to express the devastation and sadness that it made we experience and feel during the time. I want to take that concept and bridge it with an abstract and flamboyant creative space that captures my escape from the reality of COVID-19 and the chaos that it had brought with it, this space would mark my hopeful and excited emotional transition that would soon flourish into something greater. I want to capture paintings, art supplies, and a redundant amount of unique creations to flesh out how in tune I was in my own little creative bubble. And finally, I want a third space where I encounter to give off an **end of the journey** type of feel, exhibiing a peaceful, happy and tranquil ending to the emotional rollercoaster that has been the past half decade.

## Assets and Sounds

I have curated a list of potential assets, background tracks, and music SFX that maybe of effect and use for my project. I referred to my mindmap to garner inspiration and built upon that image.
