## Spatial Environment Modelling 

In our first official session for assignment 3, we began by examining the brief and breaking down what is required of us to complete within this assignment. The overarching goal is to create a "navigable" or otherwise operable playbox that depicts a space or setting that represents a transformation that we (the students) have undergone at some point during our lives. This transformation may be portrayed through an emotional, intellectual, or geographical change.

## Space Modelling Practice 

In class, we were tasked to replicate the model of a solar system, using SolarSystemScope as the basis for our model. It is within this site, where we sampled the textured elements and materials needed to colourize our geometric shapes. In this demo, Mx. Thomas provided us a runthrough of how to install and operate UnityHub as well to the solar system model to life.

## Solar System Model 

This here was my finished product. The design is rather simple yet intuitive, I will look further into sourcing different assets that appear more natural as I had ran into an issue of having to piece together two assets to form saturn - being the ring and the sphere itself. I looked onto SketchFad for inspiration and discovered alot of fantastic results!
