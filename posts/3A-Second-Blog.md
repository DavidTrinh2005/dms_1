## Land Texture Experimentation

In our second lesson, we went through the slides containing fundemental spatial design elements and concepts. After this brief, we fired Unity Hub and developed a system for creating land textures and mass. We dedicated time to creating and modifying our environments and landscapes. Mx. Thomas did a run through on how to incorporate land peaks and mountains in our space and further proceeded by teaching us how to add a texture layer on the mountain. I opted for a sandy texture with stoney mountainous peaks.

# Homework


## Greybox Prototype 

For this session, I designed a minimalistic greybox prototype. I mapped out three connective worlds, laid out in a straight linear path. I didn't want any diagonal, zig zag or twisted trail path since my worlds are scaled to a large size naturally. I want the user to be able to have a good look around the world and take in everything that it has to offer, similar to wonderland! - With that said, I utilised mostly cubes and terrain to map out the basis of my prototype, spheres and cubes aren't as of much use to me as I feel that these geometrical shapes don't provide the feel that I'm going for.
