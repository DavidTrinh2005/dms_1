## Land Texture Experimentation

In our second lesson, we went through the slides containing fundemental spatial design elements and concepts. After this brief, we fired Unity Hub and developed a system for creating land textures and mass. We dedicated time to creating and modifying our environments and landscapes. Mx. Thomas did a run through on how to incorporate land peaks and mountains in our space and further proceeded by teaching us how to add a texture layer on the mountain. I opted for a sandy texture with stoney mountainous peaks.
