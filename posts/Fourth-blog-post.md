My self portrait shortfilm will encapsulate the duality between my previous mundane life routine of having to waking up, commute, study, and return home verses the future life where I hope to be able to pause and internalise everything that is laid beyond my path. To capture the essence of what was my everyday repetitve routinely life, I will incorporate elements of repetition and natural lighting to emphasize the days having passed by quick but in the grander timeline, feels much long lasting and dragged out. By capturing quick simultaneous shots of the early commute, studies, arrival home, and clocking off will hopefully lead into a continious sequence of events that visually narrate the idea of an average student. The cut off/turning point however, being the ripped note, will represent the exact moment I consciously decided to seek further beyond just the everday life and branch into a new leaf of seizing moments and embracing the natural life. 

With the idea of this shortfilm being captured in the cinematic mode, I want to utilise fade in and fade outs for dramatical impact. To illicit the mundane everyday student life I want to do quick cuts between shots to showcase how fast the days go by. To illicit the feeling of emptiness and a desire for more, I purposefully won't include myself too often in the particular shots to visuall represent that I am not wholeheartedly present in the moment.
